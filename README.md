With this mod, you'll start off with 1 heart. Every time you die, 1 heart will be added. If you die with 10 hearts, you'll be put in spectator mode.



Admin commands:

/sethealth [playername] [amount of hearts] (sets player max health)

/gethealth [playername] (gives you the health and max health of a player) (NOT GIVING AN OUTPUT AT THE MOMENT, WILL BE FIXED NEXT UPDATE)

/about xlifehealth (about page of the mod)


Have fun!

 
 
I've made this mod without any Forge coding knowledge, so it can have some bugs in it. Please report bugs to: daqemyt@gmail.com.
